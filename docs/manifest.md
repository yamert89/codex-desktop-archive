# Manifest Format

Every release includes `codex-desktop-manifest.json`.

New manifests describe the unified ChatGPT desktop app, including the Codex experience. Older manifests in `manifest/history/` remain unchanged historical Codex Desktop records.

The manifest is designed to be readable by humans and strict enough for scripts.

## Artifact Fields

Each artifact records:

- platform
- classification
- filename
- SHA-256
- byte size
- source metadata
- app metadata when available
- mounted DMG top-level inventory and rejected external payload list
- verification result

## Classifications

`full-installer`:

- The artifact is a full installer package for a platform.
- Current macOS DMG captures use this classification.

## Release Identity

When the macOS app version is available, release tags use:

```text
chatgpt-v<version>
```

Example:

```text
chatgpt-v26.707.51957
```

When app version is not available, tags fall back to:

```text
chatgpt-capture-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Fallback manifests use `partial` evidence level. The publication workflow currently rejects partial manifests, so normal public releases require a macOS app version and strong evidence.
